Hi Guys!
This project is about guessing game using python DONE IN VSCODE.
This is beginner friendly one with a great understanding about loops and conditional statements.
**Here we use if statements **
1.To check whether the user wants the game easy or tough,
2.To check whether the no guessed by the user and the actual no is same,
3.To check the number of turns they have 
 And then we use while loop to repeat if the number guessed by the user is not equal to actual one and thus continues...
